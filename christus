why im a christian
started off with approaching with scientific method - an hypothesis that can not be tested
should be rejected. And that is said in a neutral way, but really it is assumed as proof
of non-existence. like  inocent until proven guilty. and there is a place for that of course,
but when it comes to things that can not be empirically  measured - it becomes tricky.
and after i overcame my emotions, since humans are not logical alone (that will make us robots) -
 fears of infinity to be precise - the binary options of existence/non-existence became a simple
choice: and i chose the most optimistic one. after that it was a simple process of elimination 
of which religion. i decided that i would just make it up as i go along, but soon realised that
i was just reinventing the weel. reinventing christianity to be precise. so i said fuck it. i guess
im a christian now.
